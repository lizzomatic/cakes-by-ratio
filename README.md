I was looking for the perfect fruit-forward, healthy breakfast cake. I am allergic to oats and wheat, and most things grass-related, and don't like the energy surge/crash cycle of sugary breakfast foods. I couldn't find what I wanted, so I  made it myself :)

This ratio-based recipe was inspired by a bread-making book I had as a kid. I can't remember the title and my origianl burned up in a house fire. But the concept was this...if you stick to simple ratios of types of ingredients (ie. flour, liquid, levening agent...), you can improvise a lot within those bounds. Baking is a fun artform; you can use the same bread or cake recipe and it can be different everyday!
